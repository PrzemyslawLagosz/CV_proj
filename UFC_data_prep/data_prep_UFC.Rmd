```{r echo= FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

library(dplyr)
```

```{r importing data, message= FALSE}
raw_fighter_details <- read_csv("raw_fighter_details.csv")

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
